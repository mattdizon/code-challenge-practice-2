Binary Search Tree: 
    A binary tree can only have 2 nodes(children) at most at only 1 root
    The left node is less than the root, which is less than all right nodes

    Preorder Traveral: root then left then right 
    Postorder Traveral: Left then root then right 
    Inorder Traversal: left then right then root

    Typically we use inorder so nodes are printed in order
